     - Download the Project folder
     - Find index.html page in the 'www' archive and open it in chrome 
     - Then right click on the mouse to select inspect element and set the display size to 365 X 665  (width X height) as this display is for 6" mobiles
     - Start using the App by selecting different options given in the app.


NOTE- This app is suggested for 6" mobiles but it can also be used in other mobiles too. However the contents of the App might now be displayed as expected in mobiles having screens smaller than 6"
